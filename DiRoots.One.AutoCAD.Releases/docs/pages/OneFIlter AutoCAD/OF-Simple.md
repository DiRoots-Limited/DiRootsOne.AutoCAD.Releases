# Simple

The Simple is the first tab of OneFilter, and this tool allows you to filter elements Objects and refine the filter based on their properties and datas. Let's get started:

1. The first step is to select whether you want to apply filters based on the Whole Model, the Current Selection or Active Space. Select the radio button to choose it.

2. The next step is to choose how you want to filter the model. To do this, simply activate the Objects and Layers table using the switch button in the table header.

3. Now use the checkboxes to select the objects/layers you want to filter. When you select them, the elements will be immediately filtered and displayed in the table on the right.

```yaml
# Note:
Use the search box to search by objects and layers.
```

1. Open the first selection list and choose the property.

2. Click on the second list and select the condition you want to apply.

3. Enter a property value or select in the drop-down list, and click to filter it.

```yaml
# Note:
Click on Clear button to reset the filter by property.
```
